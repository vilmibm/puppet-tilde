# puppet-tilde

This is an experimental, alpha Puppet module for setting up an ubuntu server in
the style of [tilde.club](http://tilde.club).

What is in master is generally guaranteed to have been tested casually
on an ec2 micro running Ubuntu 14.04 at [tilde.town](http://tilde.town), but aside from that, there are
no guarantees about the code. YMMV. I'm trying to keep the README up
to date as I change things / add features.

## Installation

 _All of these steps assume you are running as the root user._

 * Install puppet and puppetmaster (they can be on the same
   server). 3.4.x+ is required.
 * `puppet module install jfryman-nginx`
 * `puppet module install camptocamp-postfix`
 * Set up hiera:
  * add a [hiera.yaml](https://github.com/nathanielksmith/puppet-tilde/tree/master/examples/hiera.yaml) to `/etc/puppet/`
  * `ln -s /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml /etc/hiera.yaml`
  * `mkdir /etc/puppet/hieradata`
  * add and **configure** [common.yaml](https://github.com/nathanielksmith/puppet-tilde/tree/master/examples/common.yaml) to `/etc/puppet/hieradata/`
 * `cd /etc/puppet/modules`
 * `git clone https://github.com/nathanielksmith/puppet-tilde.git tilde`
 * `git clone https://github.com/nathanielksmith/puppet-ngircd ngircd`
 * edit [site.pp](https://github.com/nathanielksmith/puppet-tilde/tree/master/examples/site.pp) and save to `/etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp`
 * `puppet agent -t`

## Adding Users

To add users to your tilde server, add them to your common.yaml (or whatever) like so:

    tilde::users:
      vilmibm:
        pubkey: '...'
      cmr:
        pubkey: '...'
      datagrok:
        pubkey: '...'

The module purges any non-system users not managed by puppet; in other words,
to ban a user, simply delete them from the tilde::users hash in common.yaml.

You can also specify `pubkey_type` in the user hash if the user is
fancy and not using `ssh-rsa`. The supported types are whatever is
supported by puppet's
[authorized key type](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#sshauthorizedkey)

Password based logins are not currently supported. You'll have to
manually enable that if you want it.

## /etc/skel

/etc/skel is managed as a set of files in the module. If you'd like to
modify these, make a local branch on the module and edit away. You can
add or remove files from the directory (note, old users will not
retroactively get changes to /etc/skel).

## Nginx

Currently, the module looks for `tilde::hostname` (e.g. _tilde.town_
or _tilde.farm_ or _drawbridge.club_) and sets up an nginx vhost with:


 * a homepage for your tilde server (`/var/www/<your
 domain>/index.html`)
 * user directories (`/~<username>`) which map to /home/<username>/public_html
 * server names $hostname and www.$hostname

## IRC

The module sets up ngircd for you.

 * localhost only
 * "irc" alias added to users' .bashrc
 * per-user irssi config this will auto-connect to the
   server and auto-join #<hostname> where hostname is a .-less string
   substitution of the hostname you specified as `tilde::hostname`.

It does **not** set up an operator. IRC governance is up to the
autonomous collective to determine.

## Mail

The module sets up postfix for you. Just like tilde.club, it's local
mail only. Alpine and mutt are installed by default.

## MotD

There is basic Message of the Day support. To customize the motd, make
a branch of the checked out puppet module and edit
`templates/motd.erb`. The default template just has a basic cowsay
with a few instructions (and shows your server's hostname).

A `motd` alias that just runs `cat /etc/motd` is also added by the
aliases file in skel.

## NNTP (Usenet)

The program `inn2` is set up and configured for local access. The clients `slrn`, `tin`, and `alpine` are all installed by default. In order to transfer news with peers, you must enable both inbound and outbound traffic on TCP port 119 (for EC2 users, this may mean editing your security groups, for others it may mean editing iptables rules).

**IMPORTANT**: Refer to [the example common.yaml file](https://github.com/nathanielksmith/puppet-tilde/tree/master/examples/common.yaml) to see how to configure newsgroups/peers. No groups are configured by default.

## Quota support

This module enables 3mb user quotas for all non-system users. You'll
need to add the usrquota option to your / mount with something like
this in your `site.pp`, though, for it to work:

    mount { '/':
        ensure  => 'mounted',
        device  => 'LABEL=cloudimg-rootfs',
        dump    => '0',
        fstype  => 'ext4',
        options => 'defaults,discard,usrquota',
        pass    => '0',
        target  => '/etc/fstab',
      }
    }

If you **do not want disk quotas**, include the tilde class like this
in your `site.pp`:

    class { 'tilde':
        use_quota => false,
    }

or configure common.yaml with

    tilde::use_quota: false

## TODO

 * A "customization" section in this README on how to modify things
   like the server's homepage or /etc/skel.
 * Flags for switching on/off various services from common.yaml (if
   you don't want NTTP, for example).
